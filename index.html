            <h2>The Stanford Season Begins Again!</h2>
            <p>We've made it a full year around the sun together and return for another Stanford football season. We have so many more memories from the last year, but these I thought were some of the milestones.  Here is to another year of Stanford Football, more quotes, laughs, little tiffs, good sex, and a helluva lot more memories. Thanks for being my best friend and the best boyfriend a girl could ever ask for. I love you more than you will ever know. The next year continues with more firsts...with our first plane ride together, to our first wedding together. I cannot wait to see what the next year brings us. One year down, forever to go! Love you, garbonzo bean. Forever and ever. </p>
